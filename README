You can use tests only on Linux

For running test you need to:

1. Create file (.env) in the project directory
2. In the file write:

    user_name = ""
    user_password = ""

    user_id = ""
    user_secret = ""

In the user_name and user_password you need to write credentials for Magento.
In the user_id and user_secret you need to write credentials for Walmart.

3. Install required packages with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open Terminal and go to the autotests directory.
5. Run autotest with the command: pytest -v --tb=line test_walmart_wizard.py
