You can use tests only on Linux

For running test you need to:

1. Create file (.env) in the project directory
2. In the file write:

    user_name = ""
    user_password = ""

    user_id_walmart = ""
    user_secret_walmart = ""

    user_id_ebay = ""
    user_secret_ebay = ""

    user_id_amazon = ""
    user_secret_amazon = ""
    two_step_auth = ""

In the user_name and user_password you need to write credentials for Magento.
In the user_id_walmart and user_secret_walmart you need to write credentials for Walmart.
In the user_id_ebay and user_secret_ebay you need to write credentials for eBay.
In the user_id_amazon and user_secret_amazon you need to write credentials for Amazon.
In the two_step_auth you need to write code for the two step verification which is required during amazon account on-boarding

3. In file local_config.py change VM_IP on your Virtual Machine IP (10.0.30.XXX)
4. Install required packages with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Open Terminal and go to the autotests directory.
6. Run autotest with the command: pytest -v --tb=line test_walmart_wizard.py
